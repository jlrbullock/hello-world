# hello-world
Intro training for GitHub and first repository

I'm a public health professional passionate about using evidence-based approaches in electronic health records, and public health programs and policy to eliminate health disparities and maximize efficacy and impact. You could say I'm a little bit of a data scientist enthusiast as I enjoy learning how to maximize the tools provided in various statistical analysis software like STATA, R, SAS, SPSS, SQL, etc. I look forward to further exploring this software and learning how to operate other software like MatLab and Python.
